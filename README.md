# Getting started with Atomico + Snowpack

[EspaÃ±ol](./lang/spanish.md) [English](./README.md)

This configuration allows a dynamic development based on Snowpack, using the `npm start` scripts you can develop components that are displayed by the browser thanks to a server with local livereload taught by console, by default it can be hosted on the `localhost:8080` port.

## Directory

```bash
/src
    /components # Directory for webcomponents
        /atomico-counter # Example of component with Atomico
            atomico-counter.js
            atomico-counter.css
            atomico-counter.md  # component documentation
    index.html # Html file to serve on the server
```

> files exported from html are stored processed in `/docs`(Friendly with github pages ðŸ˜Ž), you can change this effect by modifying the`scripts` of `package.json`.

## Scripts
